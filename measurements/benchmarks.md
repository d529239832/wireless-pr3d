# Contribution

1. Tail probability analysis of wireless networks delay
  a. Publish the datasets for others to use
  b. Associate the tail to any condition
  c. Show that EVT predictor works in practice (real data from real networks)


# Measurement schemes

1. network technologies, location, RSRP, MCS, channel (Characterize the server)

EP5G, IEEE 802.11g, Openairinterface 5G
pt1, pt2, pt3

2. Different link utilization (Characterize the load)

high, mid, low untilization 
relation to tail location and index
